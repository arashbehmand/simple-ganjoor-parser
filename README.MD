This code is meant to provide a simple web interface for Ganjoor open persian poetry database.
Database file is not included, you can find ganjoor.s3db at The main project's development site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ganjoor/). beware that this code is designed for an old version, so it may be not compatible with the current DB.
I am not sure about licensing or copyright status of Ganjoor DB, so use it with you own responsibility.
This code is licensed under GNU GPL.
Note that it is a very old project that I decided to put on github. I Hope it could be helpful for someone.
